## Define Success

"Your talk will be helpful to me if you discuss ________?

Fine to put incomplete projects on your potfolio    
* Don't say that it is not finshed
* Do list the things that are complete

<hr>

</br>

## Resume vs Portfolio

For your portfolio, start at Google --> Google yourself

Have yourself be Googlealbe

Create online pressence

What does it take to increase your rank on Google

## Linkedin

*****Speed matters***** 
* By-line
    * what is the first line --> it's super important
    * when you make a connection w/someone, 1st line is what they see

* If w/a company for multiple years
    * add jobs that highlight the clients you worked with
        * your contributions with those companies
* Posting consistenly helps to drive views to your profile
    * share a little piece of content 3 times per week

## Portfolio Site
### Theme
[Portfolio Theme](https://github.com/morganjlopes/portfolio-template)
* most recruiters won't notice the 100s of hrs of work done on a portfolio
* use a template
* use a tool like [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) to record yourself clicking through the website
    * like a guided tour through a home
    * brief videos
* Link to Github pushes / interesting features on GH
* Hiring managers have like 1 minute to look through your stuff
* Hobbies / Interest at the end
    * Talk about the stuff that's different about you
    * Make a connection --> people are making decisions on who to hire, not companies

# Questions | End of Talk

* Question: What is oversharing?
* Answer:
    * Nothing too vulgar --> if you have explicit content
    * You can create a Github repo of something non-technical e.g. recipes

* Theme your life with a [purpose statement](https://www.morganjlopes.com/purpose-statement-framework/)
    * Patterns in your life --> how to communicate that
